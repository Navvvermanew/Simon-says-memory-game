# Simon Says: A reflex and memory-based game built with Arduino UNO, LEDs, and buttons â€” inspired by the classic *Simon Says* game. This project lights up a sequence of LEDs that the player must memorize and reproduce using  corresponding push buttons. With every successful round, the sequence grows longer.
